Design a small address book database (name, phone number, and so on) using a straightforward binary representation in your language of choice.
Do this before reading the rest of this challenge...

- Translate that format into a plain-text format using XML or JSON
- For each version, add a new, variable-length field called directions in which you might enter directions to each person's house

What issues came up regarding versioning and extensibility? 
Which form was easier to modify?
What about converting existing data?


So with setting this up I used Java, I may comeback and try this in C or Python as I wanted to save the data as binary to a file. Best I could so was save it as a String!
Converting the String value from the saved file to JSON was simple thanks to the Jackson library
Tried to convert it to XML as well and it proved a right PITA that I gave up
